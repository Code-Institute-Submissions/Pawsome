# Description

*Note: This site portrays a fictitious business, created purely for the purpose of this exercise*

PawSome is a pet services company, offering dog walking and boarding services as well as home visits in the customer's home.
It was created by a dog owner who understands how difficult it is to leave your four legged family member behind when you need 
to be away for a long time. It's vital to know that your pet will be well taken care of and in safe hands, which is what
this site is trying to convey and offer.


# Deployment and Demo

This website has been deployed to [GitHub Pages](https://maxnyla.github.io/Pawsome/index.html)

# Wireframe

The wireframe was designed using [Microsoft Paint]
I created two wireframes for each html page, one for the mobile view and another for the desktop view.   


# UX

My aim was to have a clean, uncluttered and responsive site with a very simple home page where the main feature is a relevant and scenic background photo
that covers the full viewport and sets the tone for the rest of the site. 
The goal is to showcase the services offered and use bright, happy colours that are also close to nature. 
The header and footer design carries through the site on all pages for continuity. 
 
- Home page:
The home page design is very simple: the main feature is a relevant and scenic background photo
that covers the full viewport. The goal is to showcase the services offered and use bright, happy colours that are also close to nature.
In the center is a jumbotron that includes an 'About Me' section which is accessed through a modal window.
There is also a form to submit a request to receive the newsletter.

- Services page: 
The simple and responsive layout is achieved by using a grid system with different areas for a list of the 
services offered and also some photos to enhance the visual experience. The prices section can be accessed as 
a separate modal which opens in a new pop-up window and 

- Gallery page: 
The main feature of the gallery page is an image carousel which is, again, inside a grid system. This also includes 
an area with testimonies from customers that have used the business.

- Booking page: 
The booking page follows the theme with a grid system, which includes some information with contact details and a map as well as a
booking form. The contact details include a telephone number and email address that can be clicked through for a seamless experience.

Due to having a few large images on the site which took long to load and for the purpose of improving user experience, I have compressed the images using [tinypng.com](https://tinypng.com/) 
Total reduction in image size has been 53% (7MB).
