# Description

*Note: This site portrays a fictitious business, created purely for the purpose of this exercise*

PawSome is a pet services company, offering dog walking and boarding services as well as home visits in the customer's home.
It was created by a dog owner who understands how difficult it is to leave your four legged family member behind when you need 
to be away for a long time. It's vital to know that your pet will be well taken care of and in safe hands, which is what
this site is trying to convey and offer.


# Deployment and Demo

This website has been deployed to [GitHub Pages](https://maxnyla.github.io/Pawsome/index.html)

# Wireframe

The wireframe was designed using [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/wireframes/) 


# UX

My aim was to have a clean, uncluttered and responsive site with a very simple home page where the main feature is a background photo
that covers the full viewport and sets the tone for the rest of the site. The goal is to showcase the services and use bright, happy
colours that are also close to nature.

- Services page: 


- Gallery page:

Due to having a few large images on the site which took long to load and for the purpose of improving user experience, I have compressed the images using [tinypng.com](https://tinypng.com/) 
Total reduction in image size has been 53% (7MB).
